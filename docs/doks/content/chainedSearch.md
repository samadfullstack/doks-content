# Introducing Chained Search and Other Powerful Features in Doks App

## 1. Chained Search Overview:
- Open Doks app and enter the name of the technology you want to explore in the search bar.
- Append a dot (`.`) after the technology's name (e.g., "reactjs.") to activate Chained Search.
- Chained Search narrows down results, focusing only on the documentation of the specified technology.

## 2. Activating Chained Search:
- Type the technology name (e.g., "reactjs") in the search bar.``
- Add a dot (`.`) immediately after the technology name (e.g., "reactjs.") to initiate Chained Search.
- Chained search initiates with the top result after pressing dot (`.`), if you type `rea` of `reactJs` and reactjs appears on the top of the list, you don't need to type full word `reactJs` and then dot (`.`) to initiate chained search, instead typing `rea` and then dot (`.`) will initiate chained search on `reactJs`.
- Its Similar to "member access" in programming where you use dot/member_access (`.`) to access properties on objects.

## 3. Deactivating Chained Search:
- When in Chained Search, pressing dot (`.`) will deactivate chained search. 
- For example you've typed reactjs and dot (`.`) (reactjs.) to initiate chained search, now pressing dot (`.`) in this state will take you out of chained search to start the default search engine.
