Here are some of the things you can do with DevTools:

-   Inspect the UI layout and state of a Flutter app.
-   Diagnose UI jank performance issues in a Flutter app.
-   CPU profiling for a Flutter or Dart app.
-   Network profiling for a Flutter app.
-   Source-level debugging of a Flutter or Dart app.
-   Debug memory issues in a Flutter or Dart command-line app.
-   View general log and diagnostics information about a running Flutter or Dart command-line app.
-   Analyze code and app size.

We expect you to use DevTools in conjunction with your existing IDE or command-line based development workflow.

See the [VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/vscode), [Android Studio/IntelliJ](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/android-studio), or [command line](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cli) pages for installation instructions.

## Troubleshooting some standard issues

**Question**: My app looks janky or stutters. How do I fix it?

**Answer**: Performance issues can cause [UI frames](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/ui-performance) to be janky and/or slow down some operations.

1.  To detect which code impacts concrete late frames, start at [Performance > Timeline](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/performance#timeline-events-tab).
2.  To learn which code takes the most CPU time in the background, use the [CPU profiler](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler).

For more information, check out the [Performance](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf) page.

**Question**: I see a lot of garbage collection (GC) events occurring. Is this a problem?

**Answer**: Frequent GC events might display on the DevTools > Memory > Memory chart. In most cases, itâ€™s not a problem.

If your app has frequent background activity with some idle time, Flutter might use that opportunity to collect the created objects without performance impact.
