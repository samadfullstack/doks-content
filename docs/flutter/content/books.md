Here’s a collection of books about Flutter, in alphabetical order. If you find another one that we should add, [file an issue](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new) and (feel free to) submit a PR ([sample](https://github.com/flutter/website/pull/6019)) to add it yourself.

Also, check the Flutter version that the book was written under. Anything published before Flutter 3.10/Dart 3 (May 2023), won’t reflect the latest version of Dart and might not include null safety; anything published before Flutter 3.16 (November 2023) won’t reflect that Material 3 is now Flutter’s default theme. See the [what’s new](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/whats-new) page to view Flutter’s latest release.
