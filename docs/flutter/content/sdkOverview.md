2.  [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/sdk)

The Flutter SDK has the packages and command-line tools that you need to develop Flutter apps across platforms. To get the Flutter SDK, see [Install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

## Whatâ€™s in the Flutter SDK

The following is available through the Flutter SDK:

-   [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/tools/sdk)
-   Heavily optimized, mobile-first 2D rendering engine with excellent support for text
-   Modern react-style framework
-   Rich set of widgets implementing Material Design and iOS styles
-   APIs for unit and integration tests
-   Interop and plugin APIs to connect to the system and 3rd-party SDKs
-   Headless test runner for running tests on Windows, Linux, and Mac
-   [Dart DevTools](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools) for testing, debugging, and profiling your app
-   `flutter` and `dart` command-line tools for creating, building, testing, and compiling your apps

Note: For more information about the Flutter SDK, see its [README file](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/README.md).

The [`flutter` CLI tool](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) (`flutter/bin/flutter`) is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of developers) interact with Flutter.

The [`dart` CLI tool](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-tool) is available with the Flutter SDK at `flutter/bin/dart`.
