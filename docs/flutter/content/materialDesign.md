Material Design is an open-source design system built and supported by Google designers and developers.

The latest version, Material 3, enables personal, adaptive, and expressive experiences—from dynamic color and enhanced accessibility, to foundations for large screen layouts, and design tokens.

For _most_ Flutter widgets, upgrading to Material 3 is seamless. But _some_ widgets couldn’t be updated—entirely new implementations were needed, such as [`NavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationBar-class.html). You must make these changes to your code manually. Until your app is entirely updated, the UI might look or act a bit strange. You can find the entirely new Material components by visiting the [Affected widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData/useMaterial3.html#affected-widgets) page.

Explore the updated components, typography, color system, and elevation support with the [interactive Material 3 demo](https://flutter.github.io/samples/web/material_3_demo/#/):
