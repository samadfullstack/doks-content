As Flutter continues to evolve, we provide a tool to help you clean up deprecated APIs from your codebase. The tool ships as part of Flutter, and suggests changes that you might want to make to your code. The tool is available from the command line, and is also integrated into the IDE plugins for Android Studio and Visual Studio Code.

## Applying individual fixes

You can use any supported IDE to apply a single fix at a time.

### IntelliJ and Android Studio

When the analyzer detects a deprecated API, a light bulb appears on that line of code. Clicking the light bulb displays the suggested fix that updates that code to the new API. Clicking the suggested fix performs the update.

### VS Code

When the analyzer detects a deprecated API, it presents an error. You can do any of the following:

-   Hover over the error and then click the **Quick Fix** link. This presents a filtered list showing _only_ fixes.
    
-   Put the caret in the code with the error and click the light bulb icon that appears. This shows a list of all actions, including refactors.
    
-   Put the caret in the code with the error and press the shortcut (**Command+.** on macOS, **Control+.** elsewhere) This shows a list of all actions, including refactors.

This tool has two options:

-   To see a full list of available changes, run the following command:
    
-   To apply all changes in bulk, run the following command:
