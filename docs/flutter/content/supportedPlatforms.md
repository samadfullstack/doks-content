## Support tiers

We define three tiers of support for the platforms on which apps built with Flutter might be deployed:

1.  **Supported**  
    Google-tested platforms that are automatically tested on every commit by continuous integration testing.
2.  **Best effort**  
    Platforms that we intend to support through coding practices, but are only tested on an ad-hoc basis.
3.  **Unsupported**  
    Platforms that we don’t test or support.
