Due to security around [local network permissions in iOS 14 or later](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0oi77447), you must accept a permission dialog box to enable Flutter debugging functionalities such as hot-reload and DevTools.

This affects debug and profile builds only and wonâ€™t appear in release builds. You can also allow this permission by enabling **Settings > Privacy > Local Network > Your App**.
