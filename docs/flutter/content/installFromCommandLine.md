To run Dart DevTools from the CLI, you must have `dart` on your path. Then you can run the following command to launch DevTools:

To upgrade DevTools, upgrade your Dart SDK. If a newer Dart SDK includes a newer version of DevTools, `dart devtools` will automatically launch this version. If `which dart` points to the Dart SDK included in your Flutter SDK, then DevTools will be upgraded when you upgrade your Flutter SDK to a newer version.

When you run DevTools from the command line, you should see output that looks something like:

```
Serving DevTools at http://127.0.0.1:9100
```

## Start an application to debug

Next, start an app to connect to. This can be either a Flutter application or a Dart command-line application. The command below specifies a Flutter app:

```
cd path/to/flutter/app
flutter run
```

You need to have a device connected, or a simulator open, for `flutter run` to work. Once the app starts, you’ll see a message in your terminal that looks like the following:

```
An Observatory debugger and profiler on macOS is available at:
http://127.0.0.1:52129/QjqebSY4lQ8=/
The Flutter DevTools debugger and profiler on macOS is available at:
http://127.0.0.1:9100?uri=http://127.0.0.1:52129/QjqebSY4lQ8=/
```

Open the DevTools instance connected to your app by opening the second link in Chrome.

This URL contains a security token, so it’s different for each run of your app. This means that if you stop your application and re-run it, you need to connect to DevTools again with the new URL.

## Connect to a new app instance

If your app stops running or you opened DevTools manually, you should see a **Connect** dialog:

You can manually connect DevTools to a new app instance by copying the Observatory link you got from running your app, such as `http://127.0.0.1:52129/QjqebSY4lQ8=/` and pasting it into the connect dialog:
