Installation bundles are not available for master. However, you can get the SDK directly from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) by cloning the master channel, and then triggering a download of the SDK dependencies:

```
<span>$</span><span> </span>git clone <span>-b</span> master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
<span>$</span><span> </span>./flutter/bin/flutter <span>--version</span>
```
